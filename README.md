# Ryde-Backend-Challenge
This is a simple user RESTful api with a client that I've written for Ryde technical challenge. To run the code please follow the following steps:
<br/><br/>

1. Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

2. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/benitokun123/Ryde-Backend-Challenge.git
```

3. Inside your local repository, install required dependencies in the `users` folder and in the `client` folder using this command:
```
npm install
```

4. Put the `config.env` file into the `users` folder. For details of the `config.env` file, please contact me at **tranminhduong279@gmail.com**.

5. Go to the `users` folder, run:
```
npm start
```

6. Open another terminal, go to the `client` and run:
```
npm run dev
```

7. You should be able to see the `client` running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) 
and the `users` backend running on [http://localhost:3000/api/user](http://localhost:3000/api/user).

8. For details of the `users` api, refer to this [documentation](https://ryde.stoplight.io/docs/ryde-backend-challenge/YXBpOjI0NTY1NDQ-users).

9. Help me proceed to the second round interview :wink:.
